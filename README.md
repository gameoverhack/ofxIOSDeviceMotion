ofxIOSDeviceMotion
==================

Addon for OpenFrameworks providing access to the IOS CMDeviceMotion API. Gives access to the hardware sensors: Accelerometer, Gyroscope and Magnetometer. Also provides access to the 'software' sensor 'Attitude' (a device based 'sensor fusion' of the hardware sensors). It can also be used to access these sensors separately. 

Examples for streaming the sensor data via OSC are provided for of007x and of008x.

Tip: Make sure to add CoreMotion.framework to your projects!
